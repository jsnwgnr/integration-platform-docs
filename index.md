# Key Features

### **The world's first true hybrid integration platform.**

Established in 2008, and architected with a cloud-first imperative, the Actian DataCloud platform has unleashed its power to all manners of deployment, including SaaS, on-premise, and private cloud.

Integration Manager brings together the flexible APIs and scalable workloads from Actian DataCloud, the rapid integration capabilities of Actian DataConnect, and the raw power of Actian DataFlow into a single platform.

* Run and manage DataConnect and DataFlow jobs from the same platform
* Hierarchical configuration allows you to share artifacts, macros, and files across users with less duplication
* Expose any Job Configuration as an API
* Create Jobs programmatically and execute on the fly
* Execute and monitor Jobs in real-time
* Event-driven Job execution (File events, HTTP/S, Salesforce.com OBM)
* Job failure notifications
* Scale and partition workloads across engine pools and remote agents
* All functionality is delivered through APIs - anything you can do through the UI, you can also do programmatically
* Fully REST enabled to automate the entire devops lifecycle of your integrations
