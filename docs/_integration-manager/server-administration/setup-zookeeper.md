# Zookeeper

## Overview

ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for distributed applications. 

Integration Manager leverages ZooKeeper for Job Execution Mutex capabilities when executing across multiple engines, multiple workers, and/or distributed worker pools.

Integration Manager is compatible with Apache ZooKeeper 3.6.3 in Standalone Operation or Replicated Ensemble Deployments.

## Quickstart Installation

Prerequisite: Java 11

1. Download Apache ZooKeeper 3.6.3: [https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.6.3/apache-zookeeper-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.6.3/apache-zookeeper-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz)
2. Unzip to a Java-friendly path (no spaces), e.g. C:/ProgramData/Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3 (Windows), or /opt/Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3 (Linux)
3. Create data directory at ../Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3/data
4. Rename “zoo_sample.cfg” to “zoo.cfg” in ../Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3/conf
5. In zoo.cfg, set dataDir=C:/ProgramData/Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3/data (Windows), or set dataDir=/opt/Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3/data (Linux)
6. Add a new system environment variable ZOOKEEPER_HOME =  C:/ProgramData/Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3 (Windows) or /opt/Apache/zookeeper-3.6.3 (Linux)
7. Edit the system environment variable PATH by adding the entry %ZOOKEEPER_HOME%/bin
8. Open a command prompt and type zkserver to verify your installation.

## Integration Manager Configuration

Integration Manager uses the "zookeeper" prefix properties in the /conf/application.properties file to connect to a ZooKeeper Standalone or Ensemble deployment.

Note that any application.properties change requires a restart of the Integration Manager Service.

Example properties to connect Integration Manager to a ZooKeeper deployment:
```
# ZooKeeper Connection Info
zookeeper.enabled=true
zookeeper.connection-string=10.0.1.101:2181,10.0.2.101:2181,10.0.3.101:2181 # comma separated list of zk ensemble IP(s) and port(s)
```

## Additional notes

* For additional information and installation verification activities, see: https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.3/zookeeperStarted.html
* Replicated Ensemble deployment is recommended when high-availability is required: https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.6.3/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_zkMulitServerSetup
