3. You can confirm or alter the path to your DataConnect v12 license file using the property "engine.licensePath" (default: C:/ProgramData/Actian/IntegrationManager/license/cosmos.slc).
   * If you were previously using Integration Manager v2 and DataConnect v11, you will need to alter this value before executing any integrations. DataConnect v11 and v12 licenses are not interchangeable.
4. You can also run Integration Manager on a different port using the property "server.port" (default: 8080).
5. The application.properties file can be used for a variety of configurations to tailor Integration Manager to your requirements and environment. See the Server Administration documentation for a description of available properties.
6. ANY change to the application.properties file will require a restart of the service.
