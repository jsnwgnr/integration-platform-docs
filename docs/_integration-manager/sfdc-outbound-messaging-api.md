# Salesforce.com Outbound Messaging API

## Overview

The Salesforce.com Outbound Messaging API securely and asynchronously processes outbound messages sent from your Salesforce.com organization.

These outbound messages will execute a desired configuration and can pass any of the data contained within the OBM to your integration. Now, any time your workflow rule is triggered, an outbound message will be sent to DataCloud and your job configuration will execute. Of course, your integration needs to know what to do with the message!

You must have setup/configuration privileges within the Salesforce.com org, typically a System Administrator profile.

**Tip:**  You can monitor the messages in Salesforce by going to Setup > Administration Setup > Monitoring > Outbound Messages.
