# Why Use An Agent?

DataCloud Agent Technology enables centralized cloud management of on-premise integration jobs and related collateral.

It allows secure cloud-to-on-premises communication without special firewall rules or VPN requirements.

The following scenarios are candidates for executing an integration with an Agent:

* Database connections that require drivers (such as ODBC) or connections on an internal network
* Web-based services that are housed internally and are not externally available
* Using source or target files that are located on an internal network
